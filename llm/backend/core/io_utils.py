I/O Utilities for Safe Console Output
=====================================

Safe I/O operations for processes running as subprocesses.

When the backend runs as a subprocess of the Electron app, the parent
process may close the pipe at any time (e.g., user closes the app,
process killed, etc.). This module provides utilities to handle these
cases gracefully.
